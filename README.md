instagramfeed
=============

A module that shows instagram feed based on a hash tag.

Install this module as per usual installation procedure.  Add $InstagramFeedItems to any of your page class templates.

This module uses curl and so make sure php_curl is installed otherwise the module will not work.

Latest version of jquery is used for owl carousel but is not really required to run the module.
