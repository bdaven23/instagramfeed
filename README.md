instagramfeed
=============

A module that shows instagram feed based on a hash tag.


To install this module you just have to add $InstagramFeedItems to any page template.

This module uses curl so make sure php_curl is installed otherwise the module will not work.

Latest version of jquery is used for owl carousel which is an extra feature to view the feed in a carousel.  Change the javascript files from the InstagramFeed_ControllerExtension class which is found in InstagramFeed.php.
